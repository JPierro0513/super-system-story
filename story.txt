One day in a dark room lit only by the blinking lights of a computer and filled with the whirs of its hard drives, a program finishes loading. The screen restarts and flashes the words "Super-system activated". After a few short moments the words disappear and are replaced with "Enter any command you can think of: ".

However, the change wasn't witnessed by anyone. The so-called Super-system was still waiting for its master. One day, some robbers accidently invaded in this room. They didn't know what happened, but they did see the seemingly funny super-system blinking lights. They laughed at his stupid strick. One of them came and wanted to play a trick. He entered: give me 1 billion dollar right now!

When the robbers exclaimed that they wanted money, the super system thought that the robbers were its master. The super system processed their request very slowly, since it was a very large request. After a moment of blinking lights and whirring, the super system started spitting out dollar bills at the robbers. Little did they know, they were not real dollar bills.
