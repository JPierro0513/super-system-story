One day in a dark room lit only by the blinking lights of a computer and filled with the whirs of its hard drives, a program finishes loading. The screen restarts and flashes the words "Super-system activated". After a few short moments the words disappear and are replaced with "Enter any command you can think of: ".

However, the change wasn't witnessed by anyone. The so-called Super-system was still waiting for its master. One day, some robbers accidently invaded in this room. They didn't know what happened, but they did see the seemingly funny super-system blinking lights. They laughed at his stupid strick. One of them came and wanted to play a trick. He entered: give me 1 billion dollar right now!

When the robbers exclaimed that they wanted money, the super system thought that the robbers were its master. The super system processed their request very slowly, since it was a very large request. After a moment of blinking lights and whirring, the super system started spitting out dollar bills at the robbers. Little did they know, they were not real dollar bills.

They were a fraud! So when the robbers took the money to buy a new lambo, the police were immedietly called. "Hey, where'd you get all this fake money?" they exclaimed. "And why are they all in one dollar bills?" The robbers had no answer. 100 years passed until the computer was rediscovered.

Clearing off the trapdoor to the basement, the now old designer returns. He marvels at how after all this time the super computer still whirs and blinks. He saw the same blank message he programmed it to display. He made an adjustment to check the computer's logs. He chuckled to himself that a bunch of poor robbers fell victim to his prank 100 years ago.
