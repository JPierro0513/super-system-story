One day in a dark room lit only by the blinking lights of a computer and filled with the whirs of its hard drives, a program finishes loading. The screen restarts and flashes the words "Super-system activated". After a few short moments the words disappear and are replaced with "Enter any command you can think of: ".

However, the change wasn't witnessed by anyone. The so-called Super-system was still waiting for its master. One day, some robbers accidently invaded in this room. They didn't know what happened, but they did see the seemingly funny super-system blinking lights. They laughed at his stupid strick. One of them came and wanted to play a trick. He entered: give me 1 billion dollar right now!
